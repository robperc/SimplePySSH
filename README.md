# SimplePySSH
Allows for remote execution of simple commands via SSH using only built-in Python modules.
Based on code from a blog post by Paul Mikesell (http://blog.clustrix.com/2012/01/31/scripting-ssh-with-python/)
**If you are not constrained by the need to only use built-in modules you should use one of the better 
implementations of SSH for Python such as Paramiko or PySSH2**
